# Milestone 2

## Description
Describe what you did for this milestone in your own words.
  In this milestone, we changed the previous data members to unique_ptr of each game element object. For all this code to compile we changed  
  game_element functions to receive pointers. Then created a way to continuously and logically launch opponent projectiles.
  Afterward, we had to adapt the functions in the game class to use unique_ptr. As well, we had to implement the LaunchProjectile 
  functions.

## Challenges encountered
Describe the challenges you encountered while working on this milestone of the project.
  I had a big challenge learning how to dereference the unique_ptr we had to use. 

## Things I've learned
What is the most important thing you've learned from this milestone in the project?
  The most important thing I learned during this milestone was a better understanding of unique_ptr and how to implement 
  and use them in a large-scale project.
